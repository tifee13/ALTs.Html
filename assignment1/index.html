        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <h3>I am an aspiring software engineer currently in my third year at the University of Lagos, studying Systems Engineering and I hold a diploma in computer science from Kibo school of Technology.<br>
           My journey into tech was not straightforward. Growing up, my parents prioritized academic excellence, and although I had a strong passion for tech, I was not actively encouraged to explore it.
           However, everything changed in 2021 when I attended a free workshop organized by Data Science Nigeria (DSN). There, I got introduced  to the basics of machine learning, and for the first time, I saw how programming could be used to solve real-world problems.
          <br>Shortly after, I attended another workshop by CSA Africa, where I got hands-on experience in web development. I built my first game using Python, and that moment solidified my interest in software development.
          From then on, I took charge of my learning, utilizing free online resources, YouTube tutorials, and self-paced courses to improve my programming skills.
          <br>Over time, I became proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I also worked on several projects, including an e-commerce platform for schools, an online art gallery, my momâ€™s fashion website, and my personal portfolio.
          These experiences gave me practical exposure to building applications and problem-solving.

        <h1>WHY I JOINED THIS PROGRAM</h1>
        <h3>Unlike traditional schools, where the focus is on theoretical concepts, AltSchool's emphasis on hands-on learning, a collaborative environment, and access to industry experts motivated me to become an AltSchooler.<br>
           My dream is to become a tech innovator who creates impactful solutions that address real-world problems and to achieve this, I need a strong foundation in software engineering, industries best practices, and opportunities to apply my knowledge. This is what AltSchool Africa promises to provide.<br>
           Beyond technical skills, I want to improve my soft skills and two key areas I struggle with are teamwork and time management.
           At AltSchool, I will have the opportunity to work directly with my peers, which will enhance my ability to collaborate effectively. Also, the structure of the program, where submitting projects contributes to my grades, will help me develop better time management skills and overcome procrastination.
           Overall, by joining this program, I am taking a significant step toward becoming the software engineer I aspire to be.
